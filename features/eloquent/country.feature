Feature: Test if countries are working correctly

  Scenario: When country is created, UUID and slug should be always assigned
    Given there are countries created:

      | Czechoslovakia | cs   |
      | Soviet Union   | su   |
      | RÃ©union        | re   |
    Then they should have UUID-formatted id
    And they should have slugs:
      | slug           |
      | czechoslovakia |
      | soviet-union   |
      | reunion        |
